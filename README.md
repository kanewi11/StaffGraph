# StaffGraph

This project is ```analogous (Physical Access Control System, PACS)```, but in the original idea of my system there are no strict requirements for entry and eg unlock the door, but on the contrary, when you connect staff to Wi-Fi network organization will be given access to a site where staff can check on the arrival or departure from work. 

And the administrator in the panel will show who arrived or left at what time.
